## Note
This project is for educational and testing purposes only and may not have full production-level functionality or design. It is intended for learning and experimentation.

Please keep in mind the following:

- This project focuses on local storage functionality using the `useEffect` hook and `localStorage` in React and may not address other aspects such as performance, security, etc.
- Be aware that local storage is limited to the browser in which the application is running and may not persist across different devices or sessions.
- Remember that data stored in the browser's local storage may be accessible to the user, so it is not recommended to store sensitive or confidential information.
